### Guidelines to Begin
After cloning, enter the cloned directory and run `make collaborator`. You'll
now be working from your own personal branch. Any commits pushed will need to be
reviewed and merged by another collaborator.

### Command Line Utilities
There are several useful commands you can run from the terminal while in the
project root directory:
- `make new`: Initialize a new Rails application.
- `make seed`: Simultaneously reset and seed the Rails database.
